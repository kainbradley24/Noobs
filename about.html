   <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>NOOBS offers people the chance to learn new skills when using computer softwares like Microsoft Word, PowerPoint or Excel. Most young people sort of just know how to use these types of software, but we created NOOBS to help people who are new to computers and don't really know how they work. For Example, A mother who wants to go to college and get an education but doesnt know how to use a computer. She can use NOOBS to easily improve and gain skills. The main inspiration for this website was my own mother as she never went to school or had proper education and is currently doing a level 8 in childcare, but doesn't have the required skills to use Microsoft Word or PowerPoint. This website will be in constant development to help elders like my mother who want to become more familiar with computers and the softwares within it. We plan to give tutorials on other softwares and not just the eductaion ones.</p>
